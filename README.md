### Description

This is a package for implementing the Genetic Algorithm in Python. The program is designed to act on an arbitrary evaluation function with arbitrary encoding of individuals within a population, both of which are provided by the user.

Holland handles the reproduction step of the Genetic Algorithm and can be configured to work in a variety of ways.

Holland also manages saving genomes for individuals and populations as well as plotting fitness over time.
